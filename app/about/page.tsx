            Their desire to be involved with the intellectually and physically
            disabled community transpired from the love of their Daughter and
            Sister, Faith Boone. Faith was born with Down Syndrome and passed
            away at a very young age of 3 from complications due to a heart
            defect. Faith's impact on the Boone's entire family was immediate
            and profound.

            The Boone’s started volunteering with Best Buddies. They enjoyed
            mentoring and received great pleasure when their buddies would
            achieve their goals. The Boone's also learned valuable lessons in
            compassion, empathy, and determination.

            The Boone’s realized social events for adults with intellectual and
            physical disabilities are lacking and Great Vibes Events was created
            to provide fun social events for the adult community. Great Vibe
            Events offers a safe place for adults aged 18 and older to gather,
            learn, exchange ideas, acquire new skills and participate in fun
            social activities.
