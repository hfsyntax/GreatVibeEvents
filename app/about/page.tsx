        Jimmy, Andy and Mark Boone are brothers who have dedicated their lives
        to helping people with disabilities.

        Their desire to be involved with the intellectually and physically
        disabled community transpired from the love of their sister, Faith
        Boone, who was born with Down Syndrome and passed away at a very young
        age from heart disease. Faith's impact on her brothers' lives was
        immediate and profound.

        The Boone’s started volunteering with Best Buddies. They enjoyed
        mentoring and received great pleasure when their buddies would achieve
        their goals. The Boone's also learned valuable lessons in compassion,
        empathy, and determination. After high school, Jimmy began working at
        Jills House, a nonprofit that provides short term overnight respite care
        for families raising children with intellectual disabilities. Jimmy then
        teamed up with Andy & Mark, as instructors for an evening Adaptive
        fitness course offered at Fairfax County, where they still enjoy
        teaching today.

        The Boone’s realized social events for adults with intellectual
        disabilities are lacking and Great Vibes Events was created. Great Vibes
        offers a safe place for adults aged 18 and older to gather, learn,
        exchange ideas, acquire new skills and participate in fun activities.
